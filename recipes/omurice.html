    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    
    <p>
        Omurice is a <b>Japanese's Omelette Rice</b> whose recipe is flexible as long<br>
        as the main dish, omelette rice, is within the dish. For this recipe, we <br>

            <li>1/2 cup diced green cabbage</li>
            <li>2 strips thinly sliced fresh pork belly or bacon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup okonomiyaki sauce, push more for garnish</li>
            <li>1 scallion</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten with a pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Kewpie mayonnaise and ao-nori, for serving</li>
         </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>


        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>If using day-old rice, transfer to a medium bowl and break rice up <br>
                with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1 <br>
                tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil in a 10-inch carbon steel or nonstick <br>
                 skillet over high heat until lightly smoking. Add half of rice and <br>
                 cook, stirring and tossing, until rice is pale brown and toasted <br>
                 and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium <br> 
                 bowl. Repeat with another tablespoon (15ml) oil and remaining rice.</p> 
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Add another tablespoon (15ml) oil to skillet, return to high heat, <br>
                and heat until smoking. Add onion and cabbage and cook, stirring and <br>
                tossing, until just tender and lightly browned in spots, about 3 minutes.<br>
                 Add pork and cook, stirring, until cooked through and starting to lightly<br>
                  brown, about 3 minutes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Return rice to pan and toss until well combined with vegetables. Add <br>
                    okonomiyaki sauce and cook, stirring and tossing, until sauce is <br>
                    reduced and each grain of rice is separate and coated in a shiny sheen<br> 
                    of sauce. Toss in scallion, then season with cayenne, salt, and pepper. <br>
                    Scrape rice mixture into a small heatproof bowl, packing it down. Invert <br>
                    a serving plate on top of the bowl of rice, then rotate both so that bowl <br>
                    is sitting inverted on top of plate. Set aside.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Wipe out skillet with a paper towel and return to medium-high heat. Add <br>
                     remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat until shimmering. Add eggs <br>
                     and stir rapidly with a spatula, while shaking pan to agitate eggs; <br>
                     make sure to move spatula all around pan to break up curds and scrape <br>
                     them from bottom of skillet as they form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs <br>
                     are very softly scrambled and creamy (but still loose enough to come <br>
                     together into a single mass), 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Using spatula, gently spread egg in an even layer around skillet and scrape <br>
                     down any wispy bits around the edges. The top surface should be loose and <br>
                     creamy, but if it looks too liquid and raw, let cook, undisturbed, for <br>
                     another few seconds. (If it still flows, you can swirl skillet to send<br>
                     loose egg to the edges, where it will set more quickly.) Remove from heat.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Lift bowl from rice; rice should hold a mound-like form. Slide open-face <br>
                    omelette on top of rice mound. Garnish with a squeeze of okonomiyaki sauce<br>
                    and Kewpie mayonnaise, if using. Garnish with ao-nori, if using. Serve <br>
                    right away.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
